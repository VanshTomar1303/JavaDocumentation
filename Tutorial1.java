/*
    JAVA :
      * It is an Object-Oriented Programming Language.
      * It statically typed programming language.
      * It is developed by James Goslin released in 1995.


                Compile             Interpreted
      Java Code -------> Byte Code -------------> Machine Code
      Tutorial1.java     Tutorial1.class          Tutorial1.exe

      Class Syntax :
        public class Tutorial1{
            // methods,constructors
        }
        * public -> it is access modifier it means that this class all variable,methods,constructors can be inherited.
        * class -> it is a keyword to declare a class.
        * Tutorial1 -> it is a class name it can be anything (User Define).
        * { } -> All the code come inside it.

      Static main methods in class :
         public static void main(String[] args) {
            // code,statements
         }

         * public -> it is access modifier it means that this class all variable,methods,constructors can be inherited.
         * { } -> All the code come inside it.
         * static -> it can be called without the use of object name.
         * void/int/float/double/boolean,etc. -> It's a return type for function.
         * main -> main is the entry point of a java program in which the calling of other classes,and method was called.
         * String[] args -> it's an array of string in which you can give arguments on compile time.

       Simple static methods :
         public static void add(String[] args) {
            // code,statements
         }

         * public -> it is access modifier it means that this class all variable,methods,constructors can be inherited.
         * { } -> All the code come inside it.
         * static -> it can be called without the use of object name.
         * void/int/float/double/boolean,etc. -> It's a return type for function.
         * add -> it is user define.
